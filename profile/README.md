Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) is a model-free, off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm designed for tasks with continuous action spaces. It combines elements from both value-based and policy-based methods, utilizing an actor-critic architecture.
Key Components:

Actor Network: This neural network takes the current state as input and outputs a deterministic action. It is trained to maximize the expected cumulative reward.

Critic Network: This network evaluates the quality of actions taken by the actor, providing feedback for improvement. It learns the value function, estimating the expected future reward for a given state-action pair.

Experience Replay: A memory buffer stores past experiences (states, actions, rewards, next states) and samples them randomly for training, reducing correlation between samples and improving stability.

Target Networks: Separate target networks for both the actor and critic are maintained. These networks are slowly updated with the weights of the main networks, providing more stable training targets.
